# Compiler Lab Code Repository

Welcome to the Compiler Lab Code Repository! This repository contains the source code and documentation for various components and functionalities of a compiler system. The project is designed to provide a practical understanding of compiler construction and includes several key elements integral to building a compiler.

The code in this repository includes implementations of core compiler phases such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation. The lexical analyzer reads source code and breaks it into tokens, identifying keywords, operators, constants, identifiers, and symbols. The syntax analyzer checks the arrangement of these tokens to ensure they conform to the grammatical rules of the programming language, effectively constructing a parse tree or abstract syntax tree.

Additionally, the repository features components for managing the symbol table, which keeps track of variable names, their types, and scopes throughout the compilation process. Code generation functionalities are also included, translating intermediate representations into executable code or other lower-level formats that can be run on a computer.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of compiler design and implementation. Each component is crafted to illustrate fundamental concepts and techniques used in compiler construction, making it an invaluable resource for students and professionals alike.

To get started, you can clone the repository, compile the code, and explore the various functionalities implemented. Contributions and improvements are encouraged, and detailed instructions for contributing can be found in the repository. 

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different features, and enhance the repository with your own implementations and improvements. Happy coding!
